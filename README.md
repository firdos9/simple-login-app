 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-login-app.git
   cd simple-login-app
````

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server

 Open index.html in your browser (no build step needed).




    Running Tests (Cypress)

1. Open Cypress test runner:

 npx cypress open


2. Run all end-to-end tests headlessly:

npx cypress run


Test files are located inside:

cypress/e2e/login_spec.js


    Future Improvements

  Add password encryption

  Store users in a real backend / database

  Add registration & forgot password flow

  Improve UI with CSS framework






   Authentication Logic

Currently, the app uses dummy authentication(hardcoded user data).
You can extend it by:

* Connecting to a backend API
* Adding token-based authentication (JWT)
* Integrating with databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Firebase)

5. Build for production

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

    Compiles and minifies the app into the `build/` folder



   Future Improvements

* Add sign-up/registration page
* Implement password reset
* Connect with a real backend API
* Add role-based access control
